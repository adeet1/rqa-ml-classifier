# Stock Price Direction ML Classifier

## Overview
This is a machine learning classification project in which the direction of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) next-day stock price movement is predicted using information such such as Wikipedia page traffic, Google News traffic, and other technical indicators. The ML model outputs a binary outcome:
* 1 (the stock price increased)
* 0 (the stock price decreased/didn't change)

This project is an attempt to replicate the findings (in Chapter 2) of a whitepaper written by Bin Weng. The paper has been included in this repository, and can be accessed [here](whitepaper.pdf).

## Dataset
The [aapl.xlsx](aapl.xlsx) file contains data for Apple ranging from July 1, 2015 to August 31, 2018.

### Columns
* **Open**: The open stock price for the given day.
* **Close**: The close stock price for the given day.
* **High**: The highest stock price reached during the given day.
* **Low**: The lowest stock price reached during the given day.
* **Change in Close**: The previous day's close price subtracted from that of the given day.
* **Gain**: Equal to the absolute value of Change in Close if that value is positive, otherwise blank.
* **Loss**: Equal to the absolute value of Change in Close if that value is zero or negative, otherwise blank.
* **Average Gain**: The trailing 14-day average of the price gain.
* **Average Loss**: The trailing 14-day average of the price loss.
* **RS**: A momentum indicator, specifically the average gain divided by the average loss.
* **Wiki Traffic**: The amount of Wikipedia page traffic, calculated as the total of the page traffic for the following keywords:
    - AAPL
    - Apple Inc.
    - iPhone
    - iPad
    - MacBook
    - MacOS
* **Wiki Traffic- 1 Day Lag**: Equal to Wiki Traffic, but offset by 1 day. This is due to the fact that the Wiki traffic for a given day is not known until the next day. This feature is used in the model as it is more representative of the available data at a given point in time.
* **PE Ratio**: This feature is ignored.
* **Wiki 5day disparity**: The disparity for Wikipedia page traffic over a 5-day time period.
* **Wiki Move**: Boolean value; equal to 1 if the given day's Wiki traffic is larger than that of the previous day, and 0 otherwise.
* **Wiki MA3 Move**: The trailing 3-day average of the Wiki traffic.
* **Wiki MA5 Move**: The trailing 5-day average of the Wiki traffic.
* **Wiki EMA5 Move**: The exponential moving average of the Wiki traffic, calculated from Wiki MA5 Move.
* **Wiki 5day Disparity Move**: Boolean value; equal to 1 if the given day's Wiki 5-day disparity is larger than that of the previous day, and 0 otherwise.
* **Goog Total**: The amount of Google News traffic, calculated as the total of the traffic for the following keywords:
    - iPhone
    - iPad
    - MacBook
    - Apple Inc
    - iPod
    - Apple
* **Change in Goog**: The previous day's Google News traffic subtracted from that of the given day.
* **Goog Gain**: Equal to the absolute value of Change in Goog if that value is positive, otherwise blank.
* **Goog Loss**: Equal to the absolute value of Change in Goog if that value is zero or negative, otherwise blank.
* **Goog Avg. Gain**: The trailing 14-day average of the Google News gain.
* **Goog Avg. Loss**: The trailing 14-day average of the Google News loss.
* **Goog RS**: A momentum indicator, specifically the average Google gain divided by the average Google loss.
* **Goog ROC**: The rate of change for Google traffic.
* **Goog MA3**: The trailing 3-day average of the Google traffic.
* **Goog MA5**: The trailing 5-day average of the Google traffic.
* **Goog EMA5**: The exponential moving average of the Google traffic, calculated from the Goog MA5.
* **Goog EMA5 Move**: Boolean value; equal to 1 if the given day's Goog EMA5 is larger than that of the previous day, and 0 otherwise.
* **Goog 3day Disparity**: The disparity for Google News traffic over a 3-day time period.
* **Goog 3day Disparity Move**: Boolean value; equal to 1 if the given day's Goog 3day Disparity is larger than that of the previous day, and 0 otherwise.
* **Goog ROC Move**: Boolean value; equal to 1 if the given day's Goog ROC is larger than that of the previous day, and 0 otherwise.
* **Goog RSI (14 days)**: The relative strength index for Google traffic, measured across a 14-day time period.
* **Goog RSI Move**: Boolean value; equal to 1 if the given day's Goog RSI is larger than that of the previous day, and 0 otherwise.
* **Wiki 3day Disparity**: The disparity for Wikipedia page traffic over a 3-day time period.
* **Stochastic Oscillator (14 days)**: The stochastic oscillator for the low stock price, measured across a 14-day time period.
* **Price RSI (14 days)**: The relative strength index of the stock price, measured across a 14-day time period.
* **Price RSI Move**: Boolean value; equal to 1 if the given day's Price RSI is larger than that of the previous day, and 0 otherwise.
* **Google MA6**: The trailing 6-day average of the Google traffic.
* **Google_Move**: Boolean value; equal to 1 if the given day's total Google traffic is larger than that of the previous day, and 0 otherwise.
* **Target**: Boolean value; equal to 1 if the given day's close stock price is larger than that of the previous day, and 0 otherwise. This value is predicted by the model.
